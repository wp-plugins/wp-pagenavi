== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the archive and put the `wp-pagenavi` folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

= Usage =

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/footer.php`
2. Add Anywhere:

`<?php if(function_exists('wp_pagenavi')) { wp_pagenavi(); } ?>`

3. Go to *WP-Admin -> Settings -> PageNavi* to configure WP-PageNavi.

= Changing the CSS =

If you need to configure the CSS style of WP-PageNavi, you can copy the `pagenavi-css.css` file from the plugin directory to your theme's directory and make your modifications there. This way, you won't lose your changes when you update the plugin.

1. Copy the file from:

`/wp-content/plugins/wp-pagenavi/pagenavi-css.css`

to:

`/wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/pagenavi-css.css`

2. Make your modifications to the new file.

Alternatively, you can uncheck the "Use pagenavi.css?" option from the settings page and add the styles to your theme's style.css file directly.
